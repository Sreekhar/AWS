Cloud-Computing-Assignment
==========================

This is a repository to share code regarding the first assignment in the class. As per the assignment I had to do a dynamic front end project. So took some time and developed a tool to calculate the frequency of a users desired word in a paragraph (or just a dump of large amount of continuous text) of any length as well as few analytics regarding the frequency of the words used to build the paragraph. I did host the same files in my personal website at http://sreekhar.info/projects/stringsearch/. Do check out the website for demo.
